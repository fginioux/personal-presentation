        <p class="font-size-xl font-light">I was born in France in Blois in Loir-et-Cher in the Loire Valley (located about 200km in the south of Paris). I grew up there with two siblings - where there is of course a castle - until I was 19. My close family still live there as well as many of my childhood friends. Never married and no child.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="font-size-xl font-light">At school I didn’t have a great passion for studying although I was a good student, but soon I got the syndrome of "the gifted person who does not know what to do in life". So I had several orientations: philosophy and science at university, physical education and sports and then finally computer science. But today a large part of my time is devoted to improving my knowledge.</div>

I played basketball competitively for 12 years and even coached professionally, but I always liked being in action rather than management. After basketball, I practiced 10km / 20km running and recently discovered physical conditioning (cardio / strength / stretch) and I really like it every day.</p>

It's still an activity that gives me a lot of fun and despite the restrictions there is always an opportunity to dance during my week.</p>
